	"description": "This add-on lists all cards in the Hearthstone game. It's useful for looking up a card while watching a stream or reading a guide. \n\nThe list contains the card properties (mana cost, attack, health) and their description as well. You can even check how the card looks like in a tooltip if you hover over its name. By clicking on the card's name it brings you to the www.wowhead.com website for a more detailed card information page. \n\nYou can filter the card list so it's easy to find cards names, class specific cards (Mage, Priest, Shaman, etc.) and effects (Taunt, Charge, etc.).",
